# Testing Google OAuth
Go to [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/) and create a new project. Configure a basic consent screen (a comprehensive one will be implemented later). On the second-to-last screen of setup, add your own email, or any others you plan to use for testing, to "Test Users". Create a credential, selecting "OAuth client id" and "Web application", respectively. For the Authorized JavaScript origins and Authorized redirect URLs, add the localhost URLs: [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000/), where the frontend is served. Copy the web client ID into a `.env` file in the `frontend` directory using the template provided.
